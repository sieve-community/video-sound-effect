# Generate sound effects for videos using AI

A simple script to generate sound effects for stock videos. Try it out [here](https://www.sievedata.com/functions/sieve/video-sound-effect).

The app uses functions available on the Sieve platform including:
- [CogVLM](https://www.sievedata.com/functions/sieve/cogvlm-chat) to understand what's happening in the video
- [AudioLDM](https://www.sievedata.com/functions/sieve/audioldm) to generate sound effects based on the video content

The entire app can also be deployed to [Sieve](https://www.sievedata.com) using the `sieve` CLI. Read more about Sieve in the [docs](https://docs.sievedata.com).
